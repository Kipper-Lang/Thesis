The Kipper programming language has an official project website that provides a detailed changelog and comprehensive documentation on its individual features available at \url{https://kipper-lang.org}. This documentation offers an in-depth explanation of the language’s specifications and usage details. Unlike this thesis, which presents only key points and summaries of the main features, the Kipper documentation explores the language at a fundamental level and should be referenced for practical usage details.

It is important to emphasise that this thesis was not intended as a user manual or setup guide for Kipper. Instead, it focuses on the theoretical and implementation aspects of the project, highlighting the key concepts essential to understanding Kipper’s design and development. Any details not covered in this thesis regarding specific language features should be consulted in the official documentation, as they fall beyond the scope of this work.

Additionally, for minor programs or test cases, the official Kipper project website features an online compiler and editor that allows users to execute single-file Kipper programs directly in the browser. It should be used for minor programs, general experiments with the language and showcasing the functionality of Kipper.
