\section{Existing problems in the JavaScript and TypeScript world}

\subsection{The JavaScript problem}

Currently, the web space is dominated by JavaScript, a language developed solely for the purpose of creating interactive websites which has become the standard for any modern browser. Originally, when Netscape started development in 1995, it wasn't even intended to get as big as it did, so it comes as no surprise that the programming language, which would become the future of the web, wasn't exactly properly future-proofed or secured for complex operations and architectures. In the modern age of web development, JavaScript is no longer exclusively a front-end language. Wherever you go you will find JavaScript used in an application. Its usage has grown so much that there is now an incredibly large pool of available frameworks, technologies, and applications that you can use with the language. This though comes with a major problem, since the language powering so many systems today is a fairly harsh environment to work in, as it is filled with many problems ranging from minor inconveniencies to major design issues that are impossible to ignore. The most egregious example of this is the type system of JavaScript. It provides neither type checks nor warnings, doesn't allow for objects to be matched against types and requires the user to always know what the value of a variable will be at runtime, making it a constant game of remembering and guessing. Naturally, as a result, this has caused a lot of solutions to pop up, which all aim to resolve this issue. One of the most well-known and accepted solutions in this regard is TypeScript.
