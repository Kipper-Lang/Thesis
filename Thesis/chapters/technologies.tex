\section{Preface \& Background}

Before introducing the technologies and tools used in the Kipper project, it is important to note that the project existed on a smaller scale prior to the initiation of this diploma thesis and the following sections will talk about technologies that were chosen before the start of this thesis project. As such, when the project was reimagined and expanded into its current form as a diploma thesis, the development technologies were already determined and simply continued to allow building on top of the existing foundation.

However, to highlight the various differences and the reasons behind the original decisions for the parser, lexer and core compiler, the sections will still consider each option, talk about their viability in the context of this project and elaborate on the decisions made when the initial project was envisioned.

\section{Development Language}

The choice of development language, or compiler programming language, is a crucial initial decision when starting a project of this nature. This decision significantly impacts factors such as distribution, accessibility, and cross-platform integration. The selected language sets the foundational conditions for the entire project and influences the ability to effectively utilize the language being created.

Many compilers are initially developed in a different language, often one closely related to the language being designed. Once the language takes on proper shape, the compilers are then often migrated into the newly created language, effectively becoming one of the first test programs to utilize the language directly. This approach allows the compiler to validate its own functionalityâ€”serving as a self-serving cycle where each iteration of updates also benefits the compiler itself.

This is not the case here, however. As the Kipper compiler remains highly complex, it is currently written in another language. Nonetheless, the compiler could be migrated to the Kipper language in the future if the required changes are implemented.
